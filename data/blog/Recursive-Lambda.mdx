## What are Lambda Functions

Lambda functions, introduced in C++11, allow us to define anonymous functions where they are needed. They can come in really handy for short snippets of code that
are only going to be run once. They are commonly used as arguments to the functions that accept function pointers or `std::function` objects. An example is the
`std::sort` function which accepts a function object as its third parameter which determines how the values should be sorted.

Suppose we have a vector of people each having _name_ and _age_ as their fields. Here is how we can sort this collection of people by their age using a lambda function:

```cpp:lambda_sort.cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Person {
    std::string name;
    int age;

    Person(const std::string& name, int age) :
        name(name),
        age(age) {}
};

int main() {
    std::vector<Person> people = {
        {"Ramtin", 21},
        {"Jack", 32},
        {"Rob", 10}
    };

    sort(people.begin(), people.end(), 
        [](const Person& p1, const Person& p2) {
            return p1.age < p2.age;
        });

    return 0;
}
```

## Recursive Lambda Functions

After learning more about lambda functions in C++, I started to wonder if it's possible for a lambda function to call itself, same way as regular recursive functions.
Turns out it's possible, and there are multiple ways of doing it! In this short blog post I'll try to go over some of these methods with different examples.

### Using std::function and capturing the function in the lambda

```cpp:function_object_rec_lambda.cpp
std::function<void(TreeNode*)> inorder;

inorder = [&inorder](TreeNode* node) {
    if (node == nullptr) return;

    inorder(node->left);
    std::cout << node->value << '\n';
    inorder(node->right);
};

// Let's assume the variable bst is the head of a binary search tree
// We can call this recursive lambda function using:
inorder(bst);
```

The `inorder` function above prints the values of binary tree using in order traversal. Since `std::function` is a fully specified type,
it can be captured in the lambda expression and the lambda closure is fully informed about its type. Even though this works, it's probably the slowest
way out of the possible methods. This is mainly because `std::function` allocated dynamic memory internally.

### Function pointer for stateless lambdas

```cpp:stateless_rec_lambda.cpp
int main() {
    static int (*fib)(int) = [](int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return n;
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
    };

    std::cout << fib(10);
}
```

The code above works because of the following two reasons:
1. Lambdas can access static variables
2. In C++, we can convert a stateless lambda to a function pointer

This is definitely faster than the `std::function` solution but at this point, one can wonder if using lambdas is the best option :)

### Passing Lambda as Argument using nested Lambdas
Let's write the same `fib` function as above but also keep track of the number of recursive calls for every `n`.

```cpp:nested_rec_lambda.cpp
int main() {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> callCount;

    const auto fib = [&callCount](int n) {
        auto fib_impl = [&callCount](int n, auto& fib_ref) mutable {
            callCount[n]++;
            if (n <= 1) return 1;

            return fib_ref(n-1, fib_ref) + fib_ref(n-2, fib_ref);
        };

        return fib_impl(n, fib_impl);
    };

    std::cout << fib(10);
}
```

In this code we define a lambda inside of another lambda that accepts itself as an argument. This way, we can call the inner lambda from the outer lambda and pass itself
to it. And anyone who calls the `fib` function won't know of this extra level of abstraction. Prior to C++23, this would have been the best way of writing 
recursive lambda functions in C++ because it's both faster than the `std::function` way, and we can still capture variables in our lambda closure.

### Using _this_ keyword in C++23
With the introduction of _Deducing this_ in C++23, there is a very clean an intuitive way of writing recursive lambda functions. Let's rewrite the previous example:

```cpp:deducing_this_rec_lambda.cpp
int main() {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> callCount;

    auto fib = [&callCount](this auto const& fib, int n) {
        callCount[n]++;
        if (n <= 1) return n;

        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
    };

    std::cout << fib(10);
}
```
